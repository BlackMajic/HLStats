	<p>
		First make sure you have <a hreaf="http://www.hlstats-community.org/index.php?p=doc" target="_blank">read the documentation</a>.<br />
		In most cases it is only a config error.<br />
		<br />
		Then you can request help in the <a href="http://forum.hlstats-community.org/" target="_blank">hlstats-community.org forum</a>. But please use the
		search function first befor you start a new topic.<br />
		Also explain as much as possible otherwise no one can help.<br />
		<br />
		There is also a <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hlstats-discuss" target="_blank">mailing list</a> which will inform you
		about the latest development status and even some help.<br />

	<a name="players"><?php echo $g_options["font_title"]; ?><b>2. How are players tracked? Or, why is my name listed more than once?</b></a><?php echo $g_options["fontend_title"]; ?><p>

<?php
	if (MODE == "NameTrack")
	{
?>
	Players are tracked by nickname. All statistics for any player using a particular name will be grouped under that name. It is not possible for a name to be listed more than once for each game.<p>
<?php
	}
	else
	{
		if (MODE == "LAN")
		{
			$uniqueid = "IP Address";
			$uniqueid_plural = "IP Addresses";
?>
	Players are tracked by IP Address. IP addresses are specific to a computer on a network.<p>
<?php
		}
		else
		{
			$uniqueid = "Unique ID";
			$uniqueid_plural = "Unique IDs";
?>
	Players are tracked by Unique ID. Unique IDs are calculated from your Half-Life CD Key. You should <b>never disclose your CD Key</b> to another player. The CD Key-to-Unique ID calculation algorithm is one-way, however, so it is quite safe to disclose your Unique ID.<p>
<?php
		}
?>

	A player may have more than one name. On the Player Rankings pages, players are shown with the most recent name they used in the game. If you click on a player's name, the Player Details page will show you a list of all other names that this player uses, if any, under the Aliases section (if the player has not used any other names, the Aliases section will not be displayed).<p>

	Your name may be listed more than once if somebody else (with a different <?php echo $uniqueid; ?>) uses the same name.<p>

	You can use the <a href="<?php echo $g_options["scripturl"]; ?>?mode=search">Search</a> function to find a player by name or <?php echo $uniqueid; ?>.<p>
<?php
	}
?>

<br>

	<a name="points"><?php echo $g_options["font_title"]; ?><b>2. How is the "points" rating calculated?</b></a><?php echo $g_options["fontend_title"]; ?><p>

	A new player has 1000 points. Every time you make a kill, you gain a certain amount of points depending on a) the victim's points rating, and b) the weapon you used. If you kill someone with a higher points rating than you, then you gain more points than if you kill someone with a lower points rating than you. Therefore, killing newbies will not get you as far as killing the #1 player. And if you kill someone with your knife, you gain more points than if you kill them with a rifle, for example.<p>

	When you are killed, you lose a certain amount of points, which again depends on the points rating of your killer and the weapon they used (you don't lose as many points for being killed by the #1 player with a rifle than you do for being killed by a low ranked player with a knife). This makes moving up the rankings easier, but makes staying in the top spots harder.<p>

	Specifically, the equations are:<p>

<pre>  Killer Points = Killer Points + (Victim Points / Killer Points)
                 &times; Weapon Modifier &times; 5

  Victim Points = Victim Points - (Victim Points / Killer Points)
                 &times; Weapon Modifier &times; 5</pre><p>

	Plus, the following point bonuses are available for completing objectives in some games:<p>

	<a name="weaponmods"><?php echo $g_options["font_title"]; ?><b>4. What are all the weapon points modifiers?</b></a><?php echo $g_options["fontend_title"]; ?><p>

	Weapon points modifiers are used to determine how many points you should gain or lose when you make a kill or are killed by another player. Higher modifiers indicate that more points will be gained when killing with that weapon (and similarly, more points will be lost when being killed <i>by</i> that weapon). Modifiers generally range from 0.00 to 2.00.<p>

<a name="set"><?php echo $g_options["font_title"]; ?><b>5. How can I set my real name, e-mail address, homepage and ICQ number?</b></a><?php echo $g_options["fontend_title"]; ?><p>

	Player profile options can be configured by saying the appropriate <b>SET</b> command while you are playing on a participating game server. To say commands, push your chat key and type the command text.<p>

	Syntax: say <b>/set option value</b>.<p>

	Acceptable "options" are:

	<ul>
		<li><b>realname</b><br>
		Sets your Real Name as shown in your profile.<br>
		Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/hls_set realname Joe Bloggs</b><p>

		<li><b>email</b><br>
		Sets your E-mail Address as shown in your profile.<br>
		Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/hls_set email joe@hotmail.com</b><p>

		<li><b>homepage</b><br>
		Sets your Home Page as shown in your profile.<br>
		Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/hls_set homepage http://www.geocities.com/joe/</b><p>

		<li><b>icq</b><br>
		Sets your ICQ Number as shown in your profile.<br>
		Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/hls_set icq 123456789</b><p>
	</ul>

	The server will respond with "SET command successful." If you get no response, it probably means you typed the command incorrectly.<p>

	<b>Note</b> These are not standard Half-Life console commands. If you type them in the console, Half-Life will give you an error.<p>

<br>

<a name="hideranking"><?php echo $g_options["font_title"]; ?><b>6. My rank is embarrassing. How can I opt out?</b></a><?php echo $g_options["fontend_title"]; ?><p>

	Say <b>/hls_hideranking</b> while playing on a participating game server. This will toggle you between being visible on the Player Rankings and being invisible.<p>

	<b>Note</b> You will still be tracked and you can still view your Player Details page. Use the <a href="<?php echo $g_options["scripturl"]; ?>?mode=search">Search</a> page to find yourself.<p>
