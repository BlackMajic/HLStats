Compare the new hlstats.conf.ini with the existing one and add the new
sections

Run the upgrde*.sql file

Restart hlstats.pl

Create an cronjob which executes the player-activity.pl once a day

As you run the sql update, all the players are active. This will change after the
first run of player-activity.pl

AFTER running player-activity for the first time, players will be set to inactive
if they have no skillchange in the setup timeframe.
